## 1. Introduction

Drafts is a Discord bot designed to help users create and manage team drafts within voice channels. This Privacy Policy outlines what information the bot accesses and how it is used.

---

## 2. Information We Access

Drafts only accesses the **minimum data required** to function properly. This includes:

- **Usernames and Discord IDs** â€“ used to manage participants in drafts and display them in embeds.
- **Guild (Server) Information** â€“ such as server ID and role names, used to determine user eligibility (e.g., excluding spectators).
- **Voice Channel Membership** â€“ used to detect who is eligible to be drafted.
- **Message Content** â€“ only for responding to command messages (if message content intent is enabled).

**No personal or sensitive information is collected or stored.**

---

## 3. Data Storage

Drafts does **not persistently store** any user or server data.  
All data (such as drafted players or team structure) exists **only in-memory** while the draft is active. Once the bot is restarted or the draft ends, all data is discarded.

---

## 4. Data Sharing

We **do not share** any user data with third parties.  
Drafts is a self-contained bot and does not transmit information outside of Discord.

---

## 5. User Control & Transparency

- Drafts only responds to users with permission to run draft-related commands.
- Users can leave a draft at any time by disconnecting from the voice channel.
- Server admins control which users have access to the bot's commands.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy if the botâ€™s features change. Significant changes will be communicated through the bot's official channels.
